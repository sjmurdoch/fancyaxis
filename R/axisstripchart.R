## Draw a stripchart on an axis, showing marginal frequency

##     This is very much a work in progress and still of alpha
##     quality. See the example file for usage. It currently does not
##     deal with logarithmic scales properly and needs manual tweaking
##     of several values to suit different data and output device
##     resolution. Comments and suggestions are appreciated. My
##     contact details can be found here:

##     The design of the graph is based on a scatterplot presented in
##     "The Visual Display of Quantitative Information", Edward Tufte.
##     Thanks to Paul Murrell for assistance with handling the log axes
